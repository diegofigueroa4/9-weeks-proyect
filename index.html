        <h2>lydia Patterson Institute Biography</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="history">
        <p>Lydia Patterson Institute is a United Methodist-related institution located in El Paso, Texas. It was founded
            in 1913 by Mrs. Lydia Patterson Institute, LPI, is a private faith-based school supported by the United
            Methodist Church South Central Jurisdiction. It provides an education to students in the El Paso Borderplex
            areas to include El Paso, TX and Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico. Lydia Patterson Institute currently serves
            students from 6th to 12th grade. At LPI you will find a unique place where students are immersed in an
            academic and spiritual environment.For over 100 years, Lydia Patterson has been dedicated to building
            bridges between two countries, two
            cities, and two cultures.

            What began in 1913 with Mrs. Lydia Patterson, a Methodist laywoman acting through the Women’s Missionary
            Society of her church, began to setup schools in the homes of some Mexican Methodist families. Her spirit
            and vision is still alive today at LPI where young men and women, a majority of whom are from Ciudad Juarez,
            continue to be educated in a challenging academic environment while being nurtured in Christian values. LPI
            was one of the first schools in the US to emphasize the teaching of English as a Second Language in 1921 and
            to then merge students into the appropriate grade level to put them on the path toward graduation from high
            school. We are committed to forming bilingual and bicultural leaders for society.
